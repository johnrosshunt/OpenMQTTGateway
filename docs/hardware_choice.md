### First step is to find the board suitable for your need, you have the choice between wifi and ethernet devices:

Wifi:
* ESP8266
* ESP32
* SONOFF RF Bridge
* Sonoff RFR3
* Sonoff Basic

Ethernet
* Arduino Mega with an ethernet shield
* Arduino Uno with an ethernet shield

Arduino + ethernet shields enables faster responsiveness of the gateway and a reliable connection. 

The ESP platform is more flexible in term of installation (no need of an ethernet cable) but is less reliable in term of communication. Thanks to its higher memory and processing power it has more modules or possibilities compared to arduino Uno & Mega.

Choosing your board depends heavily on the technologies you want to use with it.
To have a good overview of the compatibilities per board you can refer to [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_5fQjAixzRtepkykmL-3uN3G5bLfQ0zMajM9OBZ1bx0/edit#gid=1098440301).

The choice between these boards will depend on your knowledge and your requirements in terms of reliability, situation, modules wanted and devices you already have.
